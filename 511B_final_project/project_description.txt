Dear analysis team,
I’m Dr. Trang at Fookla University. Our team studies risk factors for COVID-19 diagnosis. We obtained some data from the Israeli Ministory of Health. The dataset contains initial records on all residents who were tested for COVID-19 through the nation, with variables related to symptomology. It’s commonly thought that all these symptoms are potential indicators of COVID-19, but we do not know how strongly each of these symptoms relate to diagnosis.
We would like you to build a prediction model to determine which demographic and symptom variables are related to COVID-19 diagnosis. Also please present to us information about how well your model is able to diagnose individuals.
Here are some specifics we’d also like to know:
•	Which symptom most highly predicts COVID-19 diagnosis?
•	Instead of using all the symptom variables, what if we just asked individuals, “Do you have any of the following: cough, fever, sore throat, shortness of breath, or headache?” and use that variable in the model instead?
•	Could you also do the same approach again but only on individuals less than 60 years of age? (Most of our student population is <60 years old.)
•	Is it possible for this model to correctly identify 99.5% of all individuals who actually have COVID-19?
•	Does the predictive power of “test_indication” increase or decrease as time goes on? 
We’ll attach the data dictionary below. Also, we heard that you like programming in Stata but only have the CSV sheet.
By the way, we’d also be really impressed if you could somehow make a graph of the daily test positivity rate (# positive tests / # total tests) over the study period.
We look forward to your presentation.
